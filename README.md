<hr>
The stock market is a complicated and unpredictably changing market that is affected by many different things, including the state of the economy. Algorithms that use machine learning (ML) can be used to forecast stock market movements and spot investing opportunities. In our study, we investigate how different ML algorithms and dimension reduction methods might be applied to stock market forecasting. The presented models were developed using historical stock market data, including technical indicators. The effectiveness of the suggested models was demonstrated using the TCS stock market dataset, with dimension reduction performed using Minmax scaling and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). To integrate the benefits of many regression techniques, such as Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, K Neighbours Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor, an ensemble learning model was presented. Performance measures including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) were used to assess the model's performance. According to the findings of our study, the suggested ensemble learning model, which incorporates dimension reduction techniques, offers a viable method for stock market prediction.
